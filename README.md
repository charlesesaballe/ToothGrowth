Statistical Analysis on Tooth Growth

The project performs a basic inferential data analysis on the ToothGrowth data set in R. In this data set, the length of odontoblasts (teeth) were measured in each of 10 guinea pigs at each of three doses of Vitamin C (0.5, 1 and 2 mg) with each of two supplements (Orange Juice or Ascorbic Acid).
